Instagram made no attempt to request anything of me to prove otherwise before disabling my account where I had 22K followers. For approximately a month now I have submitted everyday a web base form with a copy of my state issued ID to dispute it and no one has contacted me. I created another account so that I can fulfill my obligations as a sponsored athlete and even with my new account I have been limited to how many likes I can do, commenting on other’s post and even adding captions to my own post. 
It feels personal and I don’t understand why this has happened. I believe the way disabling my account was handled was unfair considering my content never ever violated any of IGs policies. I still do not violate any but yet my activity is limited which does not help me as an athlete. I’m thankful my reputation and character preceded me in that my sponsors are still working with me but I did almost lose one but thank God for good associates.

And another 100x better if my post showed up in my followers feeds in the order it was posted. It’s not right that I put in so much effort and time, and people who intentionally followed me don’t see my post right away unless they are actively searching for my posts on a regular basis. Choosing to follow an account should be enough, why should I have to go out of my way to like and comment on their posts in order to keep seeing their posts higher up in my feed? Just because I don’t like posts by old high school friends who don’t know how to use a camera doesn’t mean I don’t want to see their photos, doesn’t that make sense? And if I have 3000 followers, I would expect at least 2000 of them to see my post. Why is it that only 500 or less of them see my post? Over time, I have posted better content, and I’ve posted more consistently, I try to post to my story regularly, I try interacting with followers, why is it that my engagement has steadily declined?

Update: I’ve spent 10+ years on this app, posting high quality content, using the new features, and Instagram still treats my account like it’s worthless. I see garbage accounts get blasted with attention and gain thousands of followers, meanwhile, I’ve barely scraped by. And now people are getting paid by Instagram to create reels, and I’ve been posting reels, and Instagram won’t even roll out that feature to me? Unreal.",2,,2022-03-02 22:54:18,,,,us,en

Instagram will turn on cellular data for other apps in your settings while phone is locked and screen is black, it will use huge amounts of CPU data even when the app is closed and cellular data is turned off...what could it be using 50-60% of your battery for when cellular data is turned off? It is literally adjusting your settings without your knowledge and combing through your personal information. It is also tracking what other apps you are using on your phone. If you want to upload pictures or videos to instagram, then you have to give it access to camera and microphone, which IG uses to listen/watch your voice conversations, text and voice messages, and all camera/photos. No data on your phone is confidential and hidden from instagram while the app is installed. you may not have anything to hide, that seems like a convenient way to just give up and allow them to steal your information.",1,,2022-11-14 09:19:42,,,,us,en

It has been an issue for quite some time now and friends of mine can never relate to my issue. It’s as if Instagram does not want me to post regularly. It is very time consuming to edit my photo, add quotes that I enjoy, put them in the order I would like them, create a caption and use hashtags; only for the post to fail and so lost absolutely everything I’ve just worked so hard on. I’ve noticed that I don’t have this issue with both of my Instagram accounts. The one I’ve had the longest, has the most issues when posting. I’m not sure how an update hasn’t fixed this issue but it’s been at least a year! This is why I shaved off two stars and it was almost three. — Also, the inappropriate flags to comments that Instagram automatically blocks, or deems offensive, is alarming. The atmosphere doesn’t feel diverse and it’s limiting to the Instagram experience as a whole. The requested reviews that I have submitted, don’t seem to be happening on comments that are not actually offensive. Instagram is deeming certain comments as a risk with a computer based system based on certain words that are used however, the computer doesn’t comprehend when a comment is sarcasm.

Not to mention the fact that they also removed their customer support email, so now there is virtually no way to solve your issues with instagram(the phone call doesn’t go through). Recently I was reposting a flyer for a high school club event that I wanted people to attend and instagram took the story down, claiming that it was against community guidelines,but offered no reason why. Why would a flyer for a high school club fit into any of the categories mentioned in their community guidelines? I tried different variations of the story, but all of them were deleted by instagram. I decided that I would request a review of the action taken against my story, but discovered that instagram says “Review Request Failed, please try again!” every time I pressed it. So not only can I not contact customer support, I also can’t request a review of an unfair decision that they made. I then decided to try posting the exact same story on a different account of mine and to my surprise it posted on that one. So essentially, instagram is only blocking my account from posting any stories through some weird glitch that I am unable to report to them or request review for. Until they are able to open a way for people to easily contact customer service and stop having useless glitches like the one mentioned above, instagram will be a one star app.",1,,2021-12-09 20:06:24,,,,us,en

I HATE that feature that is now in Instagram. To me the benefit of the posts is I can always just scroll down to review them. Now each post is pretty much a story, see it once and it’s gone forever and now I have ENDLESS ads. Once you have viewed your new posts you can’t see them again all you see are ads.  Don’t get me wrong, I do like SOME ads, they are personalized and helpful. But I’d rather they show up only in my stories than on my feed.

This is why I was really interested in using Instagram to try and help out my barber career. The one annoying issue I’m having is when it comes to trying to add an action button for booking. I have tried this with three different booking apps so far and with no luck. For example I am trying to add my square appointments app as a book option on my business account. The videos I have seen about how to do this, show that once you click on the app you use to schedule your clients, you need to enter in the URL that will link them to your booking page. I believe this is where the problem is. Instagram doesn’t give me an option to enter a URL. The order that Instagram sends me is ( connect website > please select business to connect > connect to Instagram > connection successful). Then when I refresh my page there is no action button. I have used three different booking apps in hopes that one of them would work and none of them do. I have the online booking option turned on within the app as well and it still doesn’t work. It’s extremely frustrating and to add onto it, I can’t find anywhere online to help me. There’s no way to contact Instagram, at least from what I have seen and it feels like it’s never going to work for me.

But a distinct issue with instagram is that some updates will just.. make everything wonky or sort of make the app lose its appeal. Even though reels are just straight up an accessible tiktok on the app, I don’t mind them. However, I’m extremely baffled with the recent update that changed the format of instagram videos. It’s like an IGTV/REEL format instead and it makes it very hard to save videos to folders- which in my opinion is one of instagrams BIGGEST appeals. Unlike other social media apps you can very easily sort posts into folders for later references. Making this feature that much more difficult to access is especially annoying when you are a part of the editing community in instagram where you’ll want to save certain edits to certain folders or save audios to an audio folder. If I’m scrolling through my feed it’s fine, but it’s very tedious to save a video if it’s something my friend sent me since I have to go into my account saves and manually move it. Granted, it only takes like 10 seconds, but I really don’t get the point of making it harder when it only took like 3 seconds before.",5,,2021-10-22 01:07:56,,,,us,en

I found that my account followed 100’s of people I didn’t know and of course I change my password frequently to keep from scam so I knew that wasn’t the problem. While unfollowing said accounts and many others I got a page saying. “Account compromised.” That I some how purchased followers against the guidelines I was sitting at a total of like 100 followers or so, plus the whole idea of buying followers is lost on me. I have spent two weeks trying to get this resolved. Instagram has little to no support with simple Q & A forms for assistance that just DO NOT WORK!

Sharing your own pictures, and sharing friends or mutual’s work too. The newest update makes the latter impossible and tedious. Instead of being able to simply tap the airplane icon next to a post, and then posting it to your story, you have to back out of it, go to your story, set up a new “create” post, and add a reshare sticker. This makes resharing on the fly incredibly annoying. It slows the spread of posts, and is basically discouraging people from sharing others work in the first place. This is detrimental to communities like activists, artists (who you don’t seem to care much about anyways), content creators, and more. You are effective killing the main source communication and collaboration within your app. Whether you think videos are the hit new thing or not, you ARE NOT TIKTOK. Stay in your lane, or you’ll lose every loyal user. If you’re trying to be something completely new, then make a new app, and leave Insta alone! Nobody comes to Instagram expecting TikTok like content, and that will never change no matter how hard you push that type of content. If you actually care about the stability of your user base, and the Insta community as a whole, please return the old resharing. You can keep your Reels, sure, I don’t care, but removing the biggest part of your app in hopes that it will make everyone want to only look at Reels content is a terrible idea.",1,,2021-07-16 16:36:06,,,,us,en

First is the amount of bots, fake, and duplicate accounts that are on IG. Myself and some others  (possibly) use IG as a place for photography, businesses, reaching a broader community to share the similar likes, or just for fun. With those few listed accounts, it limits who can see your posts and your account. I can see/understand if someone has a business and personal account. But to have 3+ accounts that are the exactly the same and are troll pages then why keep them up? 

Also there are times especially now (not sure if it’s happening to some people or not) is accounts and people who are clearly going against the TOS and guidelines with their posts and accounts. No matter if it’s drugs, tobacco, alcohol, nudity or sexual images. Some are showing up in popular feed (whatever it’s called) and some though scrolling through posts. Like earlier yesterday/today I tried reporting dozens of posts and accounts of completely naked women and a few of drugs and tobacco in use that showed up and all IG said was that “it doesn’t go against their guidelines”. How does all of this not go against the guidelines?? Also reported a account that supposedly had gotten “removed” on a couple different occasions but still on their as of yesterday with basically no consequences other than a couple pictures that were reported and removed.

There’s no other app that can connect me as a photographer to clients such as artists and models in my area better than Instagram and I am therefore forced to use it as my primary social media to upload photos. The issue is that Instagram does not support photos in any way shape or form anymore. Their algorithm has not been supporting photographers for a while and I can get over that but with the most recent update they’re starting to ruin the quality of my photos by overly compressing them. Having my photos be of viewable quality is basically my only concern when posting them and Instagram has robbed me of that entirely with no way to fix it. It’s incredibly disappointing because my following and networking is all built upon my photography account on Instagram and I don’t really have the opportunity to switch at this point. I doubt Instagram is going to care because countless people have been complaining about this but seriously if anyone from Instagram is reading this just let us post photos at a normal quality, I mean for real my photos have started to look horrible recently and I’ve been doing nothing different. I’m not even asking for much because LITERALLY A FEW DAYS AGO I WAS POSTING PHOTOS WITH NO ISSUES JUST GO BACK TO THEN THIS IS RIDICULOUS INSTAGRAM.

I’m constantly having to write to instagram letting them know that I’m blocked and to please unblock me. I feel like this is a social media app but we’re getting punished for being “too social”. It really takes away the fun of using it when I’m constantly being blocked. I get that there are spam accounts but there are a ton of people getting blocked that aren’t spam accounts. It’s getting a little bit ridiculous lately. A lot of us like to enter giveaways and comment on each other’s posts and we’re getting punished for using the app. I really hope something can change and this can get fixed because it’s really taking away the fun of using the app. I really truly love this app so much but all these rules and getting banned constantly is just so frustrating and really ruining my experience using this app.

For example, if I wanted to put a timer on a reel, the audio seems to start AS it’s counting down. This means I have to start lip syncing during the countdown and NOT when the video is supposed to start. That can be really confusing. Secondly, if I want to replay the reel as I edit, it seems like my voice is completely off from the recording. But when I click “post” and rewatch, everything is fine. That in-between of trying to make sure the video is aligned is misleading and discouraging when it’s time to post, because there is a gamble of whether or not the reel is in sync with the audio. Lastly, some reels cut off too short. I’ve had to repost reels at least three times because in editing, when I add a video to a recording, the end part is there. But in post, the ending, or “punchline” rather, is gone completely. The only way I fixed this problem was by making sure the last scene is extended well beyond the end of the recording to ensure the whole video will be intact. This NEEDS to be addressed. It doesn’t make sense for anyone to add a video to the recording, or even partial for that matter, and have to repost because of a glitch.

For a while the updates were improving the experience especially as instagram grew in popularity. Probably in the last year I’ve grown to really hate instagram. It’s following the trend of all other social media sites, It’s 75% ads, and if you respond to ads saying they aren’t relevant or you don’t like them or whatever it doesn’t make a difference. For example I get a lot of alcohol adds, probably because I'm in my 20s, I’ve asked to stop seeing them a million times and I still see them daily. The algorithm is awful. My following feed is always in a weird order, I don’t see so many of my friends posts, and after every 2 posts it’s an add or a suggested account or suggested content. Doesn’t make sense. The popular page or for you page, idk what it’s called, is terrible. I was pregnant almost 2 years ago and my entire recommended feed is pregnancy related. But the worst feature by far is the reels. I despise the reels. It’s trying to be TikTok but it’s not. And it’s really just reposted TikTok’s or content that’s pretty unpleasant in my opinion. If I wanted to watch TikToks I wouldn’t have deleted TikTok. The app is a mess. It’s not fun, and I can’t stand scrolling for more than a few minutes.

But now, neither option exists so liking pictures or reels is pointless. I basically have no reason to come back to this app because I can’t even go back and look at the art or tutorials I’ve liked/might want to use as a reference. 

I’ve also tried to contact whatever nonexistent customer service there is with no answer back whatsoever. Seriously, if you Google their customer service contact list, the only option is to report an issue through Instagram. There is no email, phone number, nothing actually useful that lets you know that your complaints or questions will be seen by a human being. Heaven forbid something good ever comes back to this app, such as the fixing of the broken algorithm that makes you view the same posts for weeks at a time. I’ve had to unfollow so many people because it was the only method to fixing the issue.

It’s a good app for keeping in contact with friends and for being able to share the things I create as an artist. But I swear the app gets worse with every update. The changes to the layout of the home page that make it so it’s basically a second explore page and so you don’t see posts from those you follow in chronological order are frustrating. The change to messages that make it so swiping prompts a reply to someone rather than exiting is confusing and non-intuitive, not to mention outright useless. The changes to the placement of the notification and posting tabs are infuriating. This is an app for sharing, not for shopping. Keep the shopping tab out of the main tab bar and put reels back with explore.

Instagram would be much more user friendly if there was an option to toggle certain features (although calling them features instead of “hinderances” might, in some cases, be generous), such as the swipe-to-reply in messages, the suggested posts after the most recent posts in the home section, or whether posts were ordered algorithmically or chronologically. Additionally, allowing users to set up the layout of their tab bar would also make it more user friendly. I’m sure someone out there prefers the easy access to the reels tab, and would want to keep it where it currently is. But most don’t. Thus, allowing users to choose which features show up on the bar would make the app far better.",1,,2020-11-17 18:45:44,,,,us,en

If you have a limit whether your intentions are bad or not your going to end up being wiped for existence. And also I don’t know who thought a limit on liking comments would prevent bullying but that person has obviously never really been bullied in their entire life because that does nothing. The only thing limiting likes is going to do is leave Instagram with bad rating and have your audience delete the app and go to another platform that allows them to do what social media is suppose to be able to do. Speaking of such I won’t delete the app yet because I’m hoping this is a fluke but I will be switching to another platform, for the rest of the month, that is able to do its job.

But killing the organic feed was about the most blatant sign of greed i’ve seen from a social media platform. We expected it from Facebook, and naturally everyone saw it coming with the merger. Its absurd to think that because you dont pay per post, even with a good follower to post activity ratio, your posts dont take priority among your own followers or area. Instagram took the fun out of discovering people and forces those who pay to play down your throats. The bigger accounts just saturate the market and everyone else gets forgotten. Personal pages should NOT be penalized for not paying to promote posts where as business profiles should. IG, like every Google product, is self imploding and destroying itself by its obsession with catering to ads. Not the creatives who even bring traffic to IG in the first place.

This is especially unfair to the fan editors out there. There are hundreds of thousands of people who make edits of their favorite people on apps such as TikTok, Instagram, etc. These fans work hard on their edits, tag the people they edited, try to make their day by showing how much they love them just so instagram can delete the photos and videos because they assume that they are trying to be them??? Clearly if you read the caption you can clearly see that they are just simply showing how much they love that user. They are not trying to be like them they are just trying to support them. If they think people who show love to who they support then why don’t hate pages get banned, reported, or disabled?

They deleted many posts based on the amoung of reports it got with out actually reviewing the posts ( the posts you deleted i was defending people's rights in , the opposite of what it got reported for , and the people who reported those posts were the criminals i was defending the victims from , they just had the numbers and the posts "" you should've actually reviewed before you deleted"" were absolutely clean and didn't violate any rule ) and I reported this problem many times but got no reply, eventually they DELETED my account that had 70k followers ""again based on the amount of reports only"" without actually reviewing the account, i've been emailing you for months and still no reply I provided all the evidence you asked for and still no reply , who the f** is working there , are they blind? And my new account is being reported too , some posts got deleted for nudity, and it's just pictures of tha dam* nature at night , are you f** serious?! This is absurd, how on earth is night time nudity?! That's a clear proof that you act based on the amount of reports not actually reviewing and doing your job , I'm deleting this stupid app and Facebook and messenger, i might use it when they hire people who actually do their jobs , Twitter is so much better Sooooo much

THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED RIGHT AWAY! US POSTING A PICTURE SHOULDN'T RUIN THE QUALITY OF THE POST! Second I don’t like how some people’s instagrams have different stuff than others. Like how for some people their can choose to color their messages and some can’t. It’s really unfair to others that don’t even have the option. The same thing goes with the bouncing text letter thing. Some people are able to move the text and it like wiggles and stiff while others do not have that option. Also it took so long for everyone to get the option to be able to share a post to your story. I remember i went years without having the option to share posts to your story, even after i sent many reports to instagram about this. So of course I was super happy when I FINALLY had the option. I have no clue why it took them sooo long to fix that when so many people were reporting that. Anyway I hope this helps and I hope instagram gets faster at fixing their bugs and make sure everyone’s instagrams are fair. Like have the same options and stuff.

And even when I get inappropriate ones, i report it, gets viewed, and quickly gets taken down and even tells me the status of the report and I appreciate this and love it so much. I love how it's not like tiktok that lets inappropriate stuff slide on their platform, instagram is quick with it and knows what is wrong and right to keep up. Love it! Next thing is it is soo easy to get around on here and use😍! Here are some recommendations: Allow us to see our profile picture in full view because sometimes we end up deleting the original photo but want to get it back, so if we have the ability to do that we can just screenshot it from tapping on our profile picture to make it a bigger screen for us to screenshot OR add a 30 day limit to where stuff we don't post or when we take pictures and discard them, they are still held somewhere if that makes sense. And the ability to where we can edit our story highlights just like we are able to in our post but with the ability to change or add music to a post or story/highlight that has already been posted! I think these would be AMAZING additions!!",4,,2022-09-27 05:09:58,,,,us,en

This has been my main social media, and was my favorite up until this new year. Probably moving to something else. How can people be so out of touch. You’ve slowly destroyed this app over the past few months. I’m not sure if Facebook bought you out but it sure seems like it.  This was a place you could really laugh with your friends and meet new people. But why not be snapchat? Why not be Facebook?  There popular right? This isn’t just about this recent update,  you’ve been deactivating “meme” pages for months and there’s a reason they get so many likes and followers. Because we enjoy them.  I don’t plan to be with you much longer. Maybe give us a useful function that’s not something snap already has, or just keep taking key features of your app out that’s a good course of action. Maybe if people want to hide all the “ig models” they like you can add a setting to hide just YOUR stuff from your followers “following activity”. The only logical reasoning is people want to hide what they like, give them the option to do that on there own. This seems to be in favor of the ig models, now all these new people can like because there wives/whoever won’t see. And we all lose a way of seeing things people with similar interests like.  Nobody wants to watch explore tiktoks, models, nba videos. I’m interested in more than what you feel like is “trending”",1,,2019-10-08 22:59:30,,,,us,en

I’ve actually tried again to create an account 2 days later using my work email and it did the same thing again. Idk what I’m doing wrong but I’m annoyed and done with instagram, that I’m just going to stick with Snapchat.

They did a good job of having the layout fill the full screen view of the X; HOWEVER, when you go to upload a new profile photo, if you click on any photo besides the very most recent one in your photo album, the layout glitches, and the “Cancel” and “Done” buttons move up on top of the iPhone’s time and battery displays. I wish I could attach a photo to this review, but I hope my explanation makes sense. This glitch makes it impossible to click either of the buttons, and you have to physically kill the app and reopen it in order to get out of the screen and back to using the app. This happens every time you try to change the profile photo. If you use the most recent photo in your album, it works mostly fine, with just a little awkward cropping on top.

For example, the comments are not in chronological order;making them very confusing. I have found a similar problem in the feed algorithm. They are not in chronological order anymore. You will see a post from 2 weeks ago, and then a post from 2 DAYS ago. Next, there should be a bigger time frame for videos. You cab only have a video that is 1 minute long. I wanted to post a slime review, but the video was 2 minutes long so I had to do it in 2 separate videos even though all of the slimes came together. Finally, I think you should fix the messages. You can always see if someone has seen your direct message. This isn't exactly a problem, but I think there should be an option, in case someone does not want people to know when they have seen their messages. Please take these suggestions into consideration. I know I am not the only person complaining about these things. Other than those problems, I have only had good experiences with Instagram. It is very easy and fun to use.

Most aren’t my real friends or most are celebrities who don’t give a crap about me. Although I can’t seem to fully let go of it.

However recent changes in the functionality of the app have been making me consider fully deleting my account. First the algorithm was changed from seeing most recent posts first to posts you interact with most, which makes it so you don't see over half of the content from creators you're following and your followers don't see your posts. Then this new update replaced the notification and post tabs with reels and shop, which seriously effects it's usability. Now my notifications and post buttons are in an awkward hard to reach spot, instead of being easily accessible. Everyone I've asked have agreed that this new update is terrible, and that NO ONE cares or asked to have a whole shopping section on a photo sharing platform. This update feels like Instagram is desperately trying to pull users from other apps like TikTok and Pinterest instead of focusing on its own user base and their wants. I am so incredibly disappointed in Instagram's team for consistently refusing to acknowledge their user's concerns. If this update isn't reversed and/or if more terribly inconvenient updates are released, I'm definitely going to be leaving the platform. Furthermore, try implementing useful updates such as being able to reorder or remove photos from old posts. I think such feature would resonate well.

It’s never been particularly impressive (to me) as a photos tool, but there WAS a critical mass of users which meant that you could reliably expect your social group to be there somewhere. Not anymore; in my experience, at least a dozen friends, in the past 12 months, have outright deleted IG AND Facebook simultaneously, suggesting strongly that IG is not an app that’s “killer” enough to overcome the tsunami of Facebook deletions. There are 2 dozen other photo apps in the iOS store at present with more features, better integration, faster processing & less battery drain than what you can find with Instagram. iPhone’s photo editing tools are so much superior to IG that it sort of baffles me why anyone with a modern handset would want to use those features. Even though I only ever perused this app for maybe 5 minutes per week by the time I cancelled, its battery consumption was routinely in the top 10, per the phone’s metrics. In fact, upon a quick check now, I see that despite deleting the app early this week, it *still* managed to book a 2% consumption of my weekly battery usage, which I’m sorry, but that blows me away. 

What on earth was this app doing to my handset in the background?!

It’s definitely not this one though. Also, IG app apparently is not compatible with any audio apps, for instance, if I try topost to IG while listening to music, IG interrupts the music as soon as the app is opened so apparently I either have to create each post in silence or wait until I'm not listening to music (or more likely just skip posting altogether, especially since IG content is HIGHLY censored by Meta to only show a couple posts at any given time so they can keep the feed at 75% adsand above). My feed NEVER shows more than 3-4 posts at a time even if I don't check for days. The rest is all ads and since they don't use any personal interests or settings to curate their ad freds, most of the ads are garbage.

It makes no sense that I can only see posts in my feed from people I interact with most—I don’t have time to scroll through my entire feed, but I pretty much only see about 20 of the accounts that I follow, no one outside those because I can’t “interact” with them. How will I interact with these if i cannot even see their posts? Regarding posts—Instagram is supposed to be a photo and video sharing app, and the quality is downright terrible. Photos are grainy, videos never load, the list goes on and on. I’m here to share my art, and seemingly, it gets more and more difficult to reach others of the trade. When I first started in 2015, more people could discover me. Now, no one can and it’s an absolute mess. If Instagram truly wanted to “improve user experience” it would. And it’s not, rather going for select posts the app *thinks* you’ll like. I can like a variety of things, so show them all to me.

Ever since it was bought by Facebook, the UI has tanked severely, and isn’t user friendly anymore. The new positions of the buttons do not make any sense, the posting mechanism is hidden along with stories and reels, the DM system is 10x worse (trying to swipe out of a conversation can sometimes make you reply to a specific message which is completely unnecessary and unused), and at this point, I see more advertisements than I do my friends posts. The only reason any of these updates happened was because 1. Instagram wanted to make more of a profit by changing out the “notifications” section with “shopping” (a feature that most people don’t use) in order to bump up traffic revenue and 2. They changed out the “new post” button with “reels” as a way to compete with Tiktok. No one wants to do their shopping on Instagram, and if we wanted to use Tiktok, we would. Everyone who has been posting to reels has just been reuploading their Tiktoks, not making any new content purely for reels.

It could take few hours and few minutes, hopefully the person gets  the idea that this is not a good source of spending your time! We all like different things and yet we cross paths in Instagram, so everything goes anything that is proper now, traveling cooking as well as all the arts are the benefits but traffic on a personal Instagram is not that great for people like me and not so famous, yet I cross path with people that are very famous yet I do not know how much they those famous ones waste time to answer to people that have something to say, yet they are showing a very indifferent behavior which equals with 0 in my opinion, is this business something to attain and pursue it or just look for exploring other people to see what they do, I think a more interactive  mindset will help more people decide the right thing to do, a more positive content !",5,,2022-07-14 21:48:57,,,,us,en

The fact i could be following someone and their feed may be COMPLETELY different from mine, but because i’m following them, i’ll end up seeing what they like when i go the explore page. Even when I try my hardest to make sure my feed consist of art and such, the algorithm still manages to throw it off by showing me people (all of whom i really may not care about) due to maybe 1-3 people i decide to follow, that has a different taste than i do, so their feed somehow ends up intertwining with my explore page/my feed, and i end up seeing the people they follow and what they like (when i really don’t care). If I PERSONALLY decide to follow one individual, I don’t need a flood of other people popping up letting me know who that ONE individual is following and what they may like. I find that highly annoying.
I also miss when instagram videos used to loop, instead of having to constantly replay it, i miss how it used to loop a video. 
Navigating through instagram is becoming obnoxious and i cannot stand it. The algorithm on this site/app is HORRENDOUS!
It doesn’t give you a chance to really just FIND someone on accident like it used to. You’re kind of forced now, to have a circle of people that all follow each other (even when you’re completely uninterested). It’s annoying.",2,,2022-03-09 20:19:04,,,,us,en

I, unlike most, really like Instagram stories and I love how you can save stuff without having to screenshot. My complaint however is my home feed. I’m tired of only seeing posts from 5 of the 200 people I follow. I wish there was a way to have it be in chronological order, but you can make it so that specific people do show up at the top of your feed. This may sound a little silly but it’s pretty embarrassing when you accidentally like and comment on a post from 5 days ago as if it was posted ten minutes ago. Really I don’t understand why Instagram is making all these frankly useless updates to the algorithm. Instead of that they should be cracking down on how the thumbnail (starter photo?) for a video has nothing to do with the video. Now that’s something that needs worked on. I feel that these algorithm changes only benefit the people exploiting Instagram and hurts regular users content intake.

If you would’ve asked me a little over a week ago I would’ve said, “ I love Instagram it’s the best social media app out there!” But , within this lovely week-ish. I’ve had my business account completely deleted with no explanation. Let’s add that it was AFTER I paid for a Instagram promotion and finished it. So they took my money, then deleted my account. I didn’t post anything more from the post that I put through promotion, just took the money and deleted it. And now after giving up on having my business go through Instagram I find today that I’ve also been logged out of my personal account, not deleted yet, but the account that I’ve had since I was in 6th grade. The account will not let me log in since I had an account that got blocked on this phone. So now I’m off of both business and personal accounts and being forced by Instagram to take an ig hiatus. I don’t understand why Instagram is targeting certain accounts through their apps, especially account holders that are physically paying them. So, please take a second to think about weather it’s worth it to run a business through Instagram with having the chance for it to be deleted with no exploration and no support from Instagram since none of their support outlets either connect you with someone or even work for what they say they do.

A few problems I’m facing now, however, include my explore page resetting (I’d have to exit the app & go back in to fix that), and not having sound when I try to upload a video on an extra account.
I also feel that a few of the features that used to be on there were so much better and easier to get to.
Archived Stories, for example. Whenever your story would disappear after the 24 hours ended, you’d get a notification saying how many people viewed it. Now, that’s not there anymore, and I have to go to my archived just to see who looked at my stories.
 Another thing is the hashtag following (or whatever it is 🤷‍♀️). For me personally, I’ve never used this. I tried it once and just thought it was annoying cause the posts would go on my feed, and I’d be thinking that I’m just following these accounts when I wasn’t. It really isn’t the greatest feature to me, as I could just go to my explore page and find the same posts.

Now the downside.  The bar area was nice and cool on a hot day, BUT the dining area facing the Lake where everyone ate was WARM and uncomfortable.  I asked if they could do anything about it and the gal in the bar area agreed that it was warm and said she would ask.  Ask?  She has to ASK when it is obviously uncomfortable?  The thermostat was on an inside corner of the dining area.
I also noticed that the whole Fitgers shopping area on the street level was warm!  They must not be able to afford air conditioning?  Not sure I would want to shop there.
Parking was on the street.  Because the Boat House is understaffed and service is very slow I had to go back and put another hour on the meter and that was barely enough.

Keep Instagram different and unique and make other platforms want to be like you, not you wanting to be like them. If the changes are based off of Statistics, realize the functions of other apps. Snapchat for instance, people like it simply because it is very private. On Instagram you are able to send pictures to people however they can be uploaded from the camera roll and used to look like the picture was taken just then.. this makes Instagram very user friendly for catfishes. Just keep the traditional Instagram aspects and forget about conformity. Make it so dm pictures- if uploaded from camera roll, it states that.

To start, Instagram’s inability to listen to the problems that its users have or try to fix them is incredibly frustrating. I was attempting to make a birthday post for a friend of mine; with a large number of photos selected and many tags. It took me well over forty-five minutes to make this post. It told me that my photos couldn’t post and that they would try again when they had a better connection. Naturally, I went to the internet, searching for a solution. I realized, after scrolling fairly far back in Reddit feeds, that this problem has been existing for over four years and Instagram has done nothing to fix it. One of the troubleshoot ideas a Redditor suggested was to log out and back into my account. When I did so, it deleted the post I was attempting to make and all of my drafts. The fact that this app can’t complete a basic function it was made to do- the creators chose the photo and tag limit, not the users- and then deletes the entirety of my work and my drafts is absurd and unwelcome.

They didn’t give me a chance to do anything. Today I also realized every account on my phone is shadow banned and I cant create any accounts anymore so yea long story short Instagram screwed me over and is the worst social app to date. Thanks a lot
EDIT: I’m now logged out of Instagram and can’t sign in to any account or make a new one and I’m not banned on those accounts",1,,2019-05-15 18:29:22,,,,us,en

I have spent the entire summer posting and building a following. I posted a reel this morning and I received a message that my account has been deactivated!! There was nothing inappropriate about the post, it was of a handbag. I went through all of the steps to report the problem but nothing is working. This is fraud. My account is 100% legitimate and I have put 100’s of hours into it. I am sitting here in tears because all of my hard work and dedication is gone. I need this to be resolved ASAP. I do not want to have to switch to TIK TOK and learn how to use a whole new forum but if my account is not restored with all of my content that I have spent hundreds of hours and more than $1,000 to create I will have no choice but to abandon Instagram and learn how to use Tik tok only. Please do not force me to do this. I have been a loyal Instagram user for years. PLEASE REACTIVE MY ACCOUNT SHOPPARKERREED!!!!!!!!! 24 hours later all of my hard work is gone. I am devastated. Instagram you should be ASHAMED of yourself. I have paid for hundreds of dollars of ads from your fraudulent vile service. You have crushed my hard work and completed negated all of my hard work this summer. Please restore my account or give me my money back.

Kelsall,Going down the drain fast,"I’ve had an account for 5 years and in that 5 years I’ve never seen a single bit of support from Instagram for anyone. Artists in particular are constantly brushed to the side to make way for unerage girls shaking their backsides and guys doing stupid parkour tricks that we’ve seen a thousand times.
Recently I discovered that they AUTOMATICALLY put a sensitivity control on our accounts. The default is the “limited” option and it limits what “sensitive content” you see. There have been posts made about how to turn this off. Howeverr for some unknown reason, I cannot. I can’t even get an explaination as to why I’m being treated like a child. So I’m conveniently stuck on the limited option with no app update and no way to turn it off. I’m undeniably angry. 
To further this, Instagram, and Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, has also come out and said they will be turning more into TikTok than focusing on being a picture-sharing platform like they’ve always been. Mosseri posted a video on Twitter explaining this. So artists, once again, are being brushed aside and left in the dust so Instagram can try to be more like TikTok.
What I’m trying to say is if you are an artist or you want to share pictures, and you don’t have time to make Reels every single day to keep your head above water, do NOT get Instagram. I’m currently looking for alternatives because I’m sick of it.",1,,2021-07-23 13:32:33,,,,us,en

I struggle with a lot of perfectionism and social anxiety, and so I tend to hold a lot of my personal value in how many likes I get on a post I make.  It would just be nice to not have “how many people like this” be the reason I choose or don’t choose to post something, or have it become criteria for my self worth.  But, this isn’t to say that people can’t actually “like” my post.  They still could, it’s just that I wouldn’t be able to see it.

Also, it would be lovely to be able to disable the explore page of Instagram for certain times of the day.  I spend hours, and I mean HOURS, on the explore page avoiding and procrastinating my work.  I like having the app around on my Home Screen, I just would like to not feel like as soon as I open it I am going to waste the day scrolling.  I know the whole point of an app is to have people use it, but I think I would use it in a much healthier way if I had the option to place restrictions for myself within the app.",4,,2021-04-14 21:11:00,,,,us,en

And the photo uploaded is the same as the profile picture? That makes no sense. I heard you can get an account deleted if you have about 15 people to report it... that didn’t work either... mind you I don’t even have a personal Instagram anymore I deleted it due to this person trying to do me harm...

I am not able to repost other stories and I’ve tried EVERY strategy to fix this problem, but it does not seem to work. You would think this problem would be fixed by now because as it has come to my attention it’s not a small group of people suffering from this but instead A LARGE AMOUNT. I love Instagram but this small bug has really irritated me, because reposting and sharing posts to my story is important to me, especially in this time. 
I’m only 15 and I might sound naive but I can say that I am very, VERY disappointed that the company of Instagram, or whoever fixes these bugs has yet to fix this one. It is a big deal considering it is one of the MAIN features of this app and it can be fixed, I know it. SO, like any other bug, it needs to be fixed NOW!! Before everyone gets angry and starts to put negative ratings on this app. 
I’m rating this a four star because I have pity on the app itself. If it’s not going to be fixed and eventually ignored, I’ll just delete it and put my rating lower. I know Instagram will see this because there are others who’ve complained and have yet to be responded.

First off, after you post multiple pictures in one post, you should be able to delete some pictures out of the post without having to delete the whole post. This would make so many users more happy because there are countless times when you accidentally post one picture in a group of pictures that you don’t like, but you didn’t realize it in time and you already have many likes and comments so you don’t want to delete the whole post and you just stay stuck on what to do. Also, if you creators made a way to preview certain pictures on a private account that the creator of the account puts up that would be amazing! It’s difficult to tell who some people are sometimes when you are only able see their profile pic so if you were able to select a few pictures from camera roll to put up (no likes or comments involved) it would be a huge help.

 Thank you creators for the amazing app:)

First I couldn’t edit my drafts in the app and would have to download them which decreases the quality of your video. Because the quality is now no longer as good the views go down. After this continued it then became so I couldn’t post cover photos to my reels and each time I did give my reels an aesthetically pleasing cover photo Instagram would remove it later. This too was frustrating. Finally the last straw was after posting a reel I began to get likes but even after several refreshes it said the video had 0 views. How can a video have likes with no views? I became so frustrated I deleted the app in order to hopefully refresh and restore it however doing this made things worse. Now my Instagram has for some reason reverted to the old version with the old discovery page and the old menu bar that has no reels viewing option or reels create option. So now I can’t create reels at all why??? I reached out to IG but instead of Recieving help I became shadow banned. Now this app is completely useless as I can no longer create my content for my page and business and I did nothing wrong nor did I violate any guidelines. I do not understand this but I can no longer try to use an app that clearly doesn’t want people like me on it.,1,,2021-12-16 03:40:20,,,,us,en

I will go on Facebook and see a picture posted that states it is linked with Instagram but never see it on my Instagram feed.  Also when you refresh it will take some of them completely off of the feed instead of putting them towards the bottom.  Can you please fix it! This is causing people to not get any likes at all. My followers say they never see my pictures unless they search my profile. I keep seeing the same pictures over and over again. Some days I get half of the likes I normally do because people do not see my pictures. This is very frustrating. 

Another thing that is annoying is the adds that I don’t ask to see. They are very creepy because they relate to the things that I like but that’s not why I got instagram. It seems like this app is trying to copy every other social media app such as Snapchat and Facebook. 

I have been having this issues about loading pictures and my followers not seeing my stuff for about a year now. Can we please go back to the old instagram where everything was in chronological order?",5,,2017-12-20 13:05:32,,,,us,en

I can deal with changes to layout, and bugs. What i can’t deal with is feeling like i am being thrown into what feels like a money making business. I understand you want to make money, but instagram originally was a platform to share photos and videos that’s it. I like to think of it as my digital journal, but now it feels like a task to even navigate and find posts that I genuinely want to see. Consider that maybe not everyone wants to be invaded with things to buy even if it is targeted to us, it is unecessary because if we truly need a product we know exactly where to get it without the need of Instagram invading our experience. Instead of cultivating posts you think I would like, leave it up to me the human to make those decisions. I like to think for myself. And what’s up with changing the chronological order of posts? What sense does it make to cycle in and out older posts from users. It is not useful, people like to feel in control. Instagram used to be a cool platform to literally EXPRESS and only that! You try too hard to fit in Instagram, stay original that was your best quality. Make changes and listen to your users, were the ones that keep you alive.

But recently I have started an art account and it was going smoothly the first probably 7 months until Instagram updated and now no one sees my posts. I’m not gaining followers because my posts aren’t recommended because IM NOT A BIG ACCOUNT. It honestly irks me to see how my hard work to draw and post almost every day is now basically all for nothing because everything is being handed to the bigger accounts. Smaller accounts are now butted to the side and ignored. There is almost no was of growing. I use hashtags, my story, and I posted regularly— yet my numbers still decreased with the new update. I feel like it is their way of saying “don’t promote? Don’t grow.” Sorry but not everyone is able to pay for that mess. I just wish everything was fair like it used to be. Why do big app developers always ruin something that was going so good? How can anyone else make it when they aren’t given the chances the bigger accounts once were given?

Please, backtrack and return it to how it used to be. I’ve had many other artists also complain and get discouraged because they feel the same way. It may seem like a problem only social media addicted teens would complain about but when you are trying to get out there and get known so that maybe you can have a career out of it, it’s a kick to the gut.",1,,2019-10-18 03:17:35,,,,us,en

I cannot recommend this app to anyone. I would delete this app in a heartbeat if I didn't talk to so many people on this app. The app tries reinventing itself and only makes itself worse by doing so. The app chooses the remake things that work perfectly on the app and make it over complicated instead of fixing actual infuriating bugs in the app. If you leave the app halfway through a text, the part of the text will show up in the chat every time you open up that conversation for a day or two until it stops for no reason at all. The app also chooses to implement other features that don't need to be added like changes to the profile page and making it more likely to mis-tap and hit a story button when trying to go back from messages than before. It chooses to implement these kinds of features instead of ones I, personally would really like like a feature to read all story's or better privacy. It also infuriates me that they have not chosen to make and iPad app yet. They know they don't need to make this app better because many people have no choice but to use it, like me.

First - Every single promotion I create in my business account says it’s approved, and still is not shown to ONE person. I’ve already checked every single thing that I could be doing wrong, but there’s absolutely nothing wrong. Great quality photo, right size, right content, insta page connected to the Facebook page, you name it. And that would’ve been ok, if it wasn’t for the drastic change in the algorithms, which have been showing my page to its followers every day less and less. The only way to get engagement is by paying them to run ads, and even when you do it, they do not work... such a disappointment! 
Second issue - someone created a fake account of my personal page and HAS BIKINI photos, promising pornographic videos as if it is me, and even though I’ve already reached out to Instagram MULTIPLE times, and have about 100 friends who have reported the fake account, after 2 months ITS STILL THERE!

But, the constant changes and addition of new features tied to algorithmic shifts make it feel pointless as a user because every new feature demands more and more of your time. If you don’t use the new features, your engagement suffers greatly, which is absurd. I don’t believe in shadow banning either, so this is not a critique of that, I’m criticizing the real ways that Instagram has said that they prioritize new features in terms of user engagement algorithms. There are a lot of us out there who really just want this to be a photo sharing app, and don’t want to perform for the camera as if we’re some kind of fake reality star. The amount of time it takes to make a reel VS post a photo is staggering, and unreasonable. It’s frustrating to see our follower count grow, our mobile-based sales grow, but our engagement at 100k is lower than it was at 10k. Make it make sense? I get it: Instagram is free and I can leave whenever I want, but a lot of our community is there. We just want it to be possible to connect with people with the ease we had a couple years ago.

We all know Instagram has been trying to become more like Tiktok, and I hate its overemphasis on reels now. It used to just be a platform of photo-sharing, and this is what made users like it and is what we want. But my explore page is just always filled with reels, and whenever I click on a (often new) user’s profile it automatically goes straight to just showing reels. It doesn’t reflect their profile, I want to see ALL their posts—the regular, curated profile with all their photos and content. If I wanted to see reels I could click the Reels button myself. It’s just a constance annoyance—clicking a user, seeing weird feel thumbnails, being confused, then realizing and having to click to the first tab.

Moreover, it’s the constant promotions and advertising that Instagram has begun been throwing in your face, all so they can be more profitable. As I’m scrolling on my feed after a while ALL I see just become suggested post after suggested post. If I wanted to “explore” other posts I’d go to the Explore tab, Instagram. I’m on MY feed to see friends and users that I follow.
