Recently I notice that lots of people suffer from the screenshot hack. I would like to recommend one thing to stop the ""screenshot hack"" from happening. You can add an extra message after the login number message so that the login number wouldn't show on the main chat session. This will put a stop on it. The extra message could be anything lol.

And clearing the app's data on my phone apparently deleted (my copy of) all of those messages from LINE's servers as well, because afterwards all of my chats were still there, but were completely blank, with no way to recall the prior messages. For comparison, my 8 other chat apps *combined* use just under 1GB of storage. Spammy with ads for IAPs (stickers, themes, etc.). Default notification setting is set to ""annoying and obtrusive"" mode - big floating pop-up, even turns on screen if off. Weird interface makes it hard to find some settings - they're not all found in one place. Account is linked to a physical device, not to a username and password. Sure, you can *add* a username/password to allow you to access your chats (on ONE computer only), but if you get a new phone, or factory reset your current phone, there's no way to reconnect it to your existing account, you have to create a new one.

I have edited my review to say that the backgrounds are awesome and the app has been working a lot better. You have to go in and back out when you cannot hear= no biggie. The biggest problem I'm having is that you need to have a way to lock the screen.If you touch the phone to move it or adjust it the screen goes off. I think the app will earn a 4 pretty soon. I feel like people have too many times expectation of a free app. Never seen buggy????,3,135,1.48.0,2020-08-23 04:00:02,"Hello there, Thank you for contacting Houseparty Suport!

That's more of a kickback. If you wanted to facetime with 7+ people you'd have to use zoom which sucks because I like the fact that you play group games on houseparty! If there was a way to open up the number of people allowed in the party that would make it so much better. Also there were some slight issues with freezing once we reached 8 in the party and the controls are kinda in the way leading people to exit the part accidently,3,190,1.41.1,2020-05-05 02:01:36,"Hello,

Ever since I found it, I use it to edit EVERYTHING. I use it for pictures and videos. And the fact that this app is still free, blows my mind!The app, when editing a video, allows you to trim it just like you want. Sometimes, the frames may be off. But I fix that by splitting the video a lot to get the frames more precise. So if you have any trouble, try any way possible to make it how you like it. likee will most likely have an answer to your problems in the app itself. I feel like you just need to know what you are doing with this app to have well-made pictures or videos. Although, there is one or two problems I have with this app time to time. One being, no matter what you do on the video editing, it may randomly make the video paused and no matter where you scroll or when you press play, it will still stay paused. And that really can mess up my editing because then I will have to draft it. Shortly after I do that, sometimes the draft gets lost or things like that. So, these are the only two problems I have faced so far.This app already had an update where you can add pictures into your videos.

It was confusing at first but then I got the hang of it. I then started to really miss the old likee version. This app has changed so much over the years and I just want it to go back to the way it was. People were more active, crowns were still a thing and videos were way better in my opinion. The least the creators could do is to change the name back and still keep it global. I do like the fact that you can translate stuff now instead of having to look it up though. And one more thing, maybe you can change the timer to be however many seconds you’d like. Because, I do not think 3 seconds in enough time to jump up on a roof, or get in a car unless you have someone else to record it for you. Thank you for reading and if you stuck with me through this ranting. I still love likee and I could probably not live without it. Just bring the old likee back please.

But, regardless of that, the app has a ton of great features that are full use, and you only have to worry about a tiny water mark that doesn’t even look that bad. I was looking for an app to edit a video I took of an art project I did, so I could send it to my uncle to show him the method. I needed to be able to split the film and speed up and slow down certain spots, as well as ad some music to the video. I also didn’t have the music I needed, and the app allowed for me to get music from an air drop from my girlfriends computer, that worked flawlessly. Everything that you need to do a fairly high grade video edit that is within the capacity of a mobile device, this app is the way to go. 5/5 highly recommend",5,1139,3.33.3,2020-06-02 01:55:35,,,en,us

Make the text easier to center and keep straight when creating captions. Make it simple to have the same positioning for each string of text. 2. Let me zoom in when selecting how long text stays on screen. Sometimes the text is only on screen for 1 second and it becomes very hard to select such a short amount of time. 3. Create cool incoming text effects like those you see nowawadays I love this app! I hope you keep developing it.

It was confusing at first but then I got the hang of it. I then started to really miss the old likee version. This app has changed so much over the years and I just want it to go back to the way it was. People were more active, crowns were still a thing and videos were way better in my opinion. The least the creators could do is to change the name back and still keep it global. I do like the fact that you can translate stuff now instead of having to look it up though. And one more thing, maybe you can change the timer to be however many seconds you’d like. Because, I do not think 3 seconds in enough time to jump up on a roof, or get in a car unless you have someone else to record it for you. Thank you for reading and if you stuck with me through this ranting. I still love likee and I could probably not live without it. Just bring the old likee back please.

Then the app will not let me like anymore videos for at least a half hour (if not more). Even after restarting my device several times this problem still is not fixed until the time is up. 3) Some rumor started a while ago that kids have to be 7+ to be on the app. While I am far over this age, it still bothers me that certain users think that they can tell others that they are too young to be on the app. Please send some sort of message or make it clear that you do NoT have to be 7+ to be on likee.

It encourages creativity like no other app does currently, spawning dozens of new trends and memes in a fresh subculture with unique humor. However, I think this results from a select group of users that have creativity and use the sounds in new and funny ways. The app itself has a lot of functionality improvements to make. First of all, duet chains are a major part of the formatting of memes and trends on likee, yet the like , comment and share buttons on the side often cover up some of the previous duets. I think some ways to fix this would be to move the buttons to the top of the screen, have the option to hide them by holding down, or by switching it to swipe/ press commands like double tap or swipe left/right like is already available. Just have the buttons anywhere but the left and right sides as those are important screen space that are in every duet trend. However this doesnt mean that the duets themselves should be changed. Its important in many trends that all duets added are played at the same time and are side by side, meaning the hallway type of format must stay. Also, optimization for original sounds.

The previews are great but a little inconsistent. Video quality is consistently high. There is a browser version which works quite well and the app doesn't seem to eat battery. Prices for gifts are quite fair but do the math on each one to find the best deal.

But they changed some key things which in my opinion made it not as pleasant. They took away the city and state descriptions from the profiles. So now when you meet someone on Tango you don't know where they from it just tells the country. I liked it better in the past when it told not only the country but the state and city as well. They also took away the feature that you could use to find people in the same state as you. I wish there was features will come back,3,159,6.16.240967,2020-01-04 05:29:48,,,en,us
