If I tap follow initially says following, but once I refresh it says to tap follow again. I’ve also tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Does the same thing. I need a response from the developer ASAP for a resolution. Do I need to go back to personal account again? And go back to pro?

Also my follower count is completely wrong I get dozens of you have a new follower notification but the number on my Instagram doesn’t change for a long time. The number isn’t correct either…  I’ve been having weird issues like this constantly. I love Instagram but I hate these software issues & bugs that are cancerous!!!

I have tried so many things from updating everything, logging out and logging back in, uninstalling and reinstalling the app several times, going to someone’s story to look for the “Try It” button but nothing, unlinking my Facebook account, changing my password and updating profile.. which btw didn’t let me change it to my personal email because it was taken already, I have never used it so I clicked on forgot password to see who has been using my email but it says that it doesn’t exist so I’m a little confused on how it has been taken but doesn’t exist. But anyway I reported the Music Tag issue awhile back but haven’t heard back since then, so I reported the issue several times back to back to see if that works (prob not). All the research I have done over this issue has been through Google through other users experiences because IG doesn’t even have support help over this issue. The only thing that has inconveniently worked was to make a second account, everything shows up on there but as soon as I switch over to my account that I use it’s not there! INSTAGRAM..

I’ve tried to uninstall the app and reinstalled it, logged back in, and it does the exact same thing pops the couldn’t refresh feed bar and keeps popping up until the current video has been completely loaded than it will go away. I’ve checked to see if the app is up to date and it is 100% up to date, I’ve checked my iPhone’s iOS system thinking that could be the culprit because it has been before in the past with other apps that acted up when it wasn’t up to date, but my iOS system is up to date. I’ve read it could be a poor internet or WiFi connection and that’s not true because my connection signal is pretty strong as I’m in the next room over from where the WiFi box is located and I receive a strong signal so it isn’t our WiFi connection. This is really frustrating and irritating and annoyance to me that it makes me so stressed out every time I go on Instagram and see that information bar there when it wasn’t there last month only recently. Please Instagram for the love of god fix this issue!! I’ve done everything I could on my end to fix it and nothing has changed.

I see more recommended posts and ads than i do people i actually follow and when i do i dont even get posts that are up to date, i see post from 1-3 days ago, even with profiles that post daily. instagram was better before the stories but that was probably all it needed, and reels are basically a knock off tiktok, the messenger icon couldve been left on facebook and i cant even see my messenger chats on instagram anyways; so whats the point? On top of that accounts with large fan bases have tons of sexual bots that spam inappropriate comments and promote inappropriate content and it’s been that way for almost a year now. Then the community guidelines violates the freedom of speech in plenty of ways to where you cant even say the word “Lame” without violating the terms of service but some chick can spread her cheeks n clap her milk jugg together and talk about how the whole internet seen them get railed no problem like ??? this app needs to be fixed before adding more unnecessary features that we never needed, we was fine after the reels update, all we wanted was the bots gone, thats it, gif jus made the comment community die and annoying to those who actually spoke to one another. basically before the gif update it was a black ops 2 search & destroy lobby, now its like an old lady making sweaters on her front porch 🙄🤌",2,,2023-02-17 09:24:42,,,,us,en

I am not able to use any music other than the few automatically shown ones that are there when I click the option, and all the songs are in some foreign language or they're instrumentals of some sort. I am not able to search for any song whatsoever as it will just tell me there are no results every time. A couple months ago, i was still at least able to save a song if someone sent it to me, then go to saved music, and use it through that. But now the problem has worsened and I am not even able to save any music nor see/use any of the music i had saved before this was an issue. I have reported this problem to instagram multiple times over the course of about 5 or 6 months and they have yet to respond in any sort of way, let alone fix the problem. I know i'm not the only one dealing with this as i've seen in reviews, as well as on other social medias such as twitter, that there have been a good amount of other people dealing with the same issues. This problem has been aggravating and upsetting, and the fact that i and many others have tried to reach instagram to fix this issue, yet have not even been addressed, only adds to those emotions. The music was one of, if not THE most used feature for me on instagram. I have tried multiple methods on my own to resolve this issue but nothing has worked.

Instagram made no attempt to request anything of me to prove otherwise before disabling my account where I had 22K followers. For approximately a month now I have submitted everyday a web base form with a copy of my state issued ID to dispute it and no one has contacted me. I created another account so that I can fulfill my obligations as a sponsored athlete and even with my new account I have been limited to how many likes I can do, commenting on other’s post and even adding captions to my own post. 
It feels personal and I don’t understand why this has happened. I believe the way disabling my account was handled was unfair considering my content never ever violated any of IGs policies. I still do not violate any but yet my activity is limited which does not help me as an athlete. I’m thankful my reputation and character preceded me in that my sponsors are still working with me but I did almost lose one but thank God for good associates. 
Instagram before you disable anyone’s account please do your due diligence and at least provide the accuse an opportunity to present facts that may state otherwise.

And another 100x better if my post showed up in my followers feeds in the order it was posted. It’s not right that I put in so much effort and time, and people who intentionally followed me don’t see my post right away unless they are actively searching for my posts on a regular basis. Choosing to follow an account should be enough, why should I have to go out of my way to like and comment on their posts in order to keep seeing their posts higher up in my feed? Just because I don’t like posts by old high school friends who don’t know how to use a camera doesn’t mean I don’t want to see their photos, doesn’t that make sense? And if I have 3000 followers, I would expect at least 2000 of them to see my post. Why is it that only 500 or less of them see my post? Over time, I have posted better content, and I’ve posted more consistently, I try to post to my story regularly, I try interacting with followers, why is it that my engagement has steadily declined?

Update: I’ve spent 10+ years on this app, posting high quality content, using the new features, and Instagram still treats my account like it’s worthless. I see garbage accounts get blasted with attention and gain thousands of followers, meanwhile, I’ve barely scraped by. And now people are getting paid by Instagram to create reels, and I’ve been posting reels, and Instagram won’t even roll out that feature to me? Unreal.",2,,2022-03-02 22:54:18,,,,us,en

Please delete those fake reviews! Please everyone find another app!

Also this app can track your data and control your phone in the background. Using latest updated iOS on a brand new iPhone 13! Even if in your settings cellular data is turned off for instagram AND background app refresh is also turned off!! Instagram will turn on cellular data for other apps in your settings while phone is locked and screen is black, it will use huge amounts of CPU data even when the app is closed and cellular data is turned off...what could it be using 50-60% of your battery for when cellular data is turned off? It is literally adjusting your settings without your knowledge and combing through your personal information. It is also tracking what other apps you are using on your phone. If you want to upload pictures or videos to instagram, then you have to give it access to camera and microphone, which IG uses to listen/watch your voice conversations, text and voice messages, and all camera/photos. No data on your phone is confidential and hidden from instagram while the app is installed. you may not have anything to hide, that seems like a convenient way to just give up and allow them to steal your information.",1,,2022-11-14 09:19:42,,,,us,en

It has been an issue for quite some time now and friends of mine can never relate to my issue. It’s as if Instagram does not want me to post regularly. It is very time consuming to edit my photo, add quotes that I enjoy, put them in the order I would like them, create a caption and use hashtags; only for the post to fail and so lost absolutely everything I’ve just worked so hard on. I’ve noticed that I don’t have this issue with both of my Instagram accounts. The one I’ve had the longest, has the most issues when posting. I’m not sure how an update hasn’t fixed this issue but it’s been at least a year! This is why I shaved off two stars and it was almost three. — Also, the inappropriate flags to comments that Instagram automatically blocks, or deems offensive, is alarming. The atmosphere doesn’t feel diverse and it’s limiting to the Instagram experience as a whole. The requested reviews that I have submitted, don’t seem to be happening on comments that are not actually offensive. Instagram is deeming certain comments as a risk with a computer based system based on certain words that are used however, the computer doesn’t comprehend when a comment is sarcasm. It feels culturally exclusive on the app at times and it’s a concern for many reasons.",3,,2022-05-10 00:31:07,,,,us,en
9,App Store,968c7e4e-ffd3-42db-a766-22e623670efa,HannahtheCat786*,awful,"literally the worst app. i used to enjoy using instagram a lot, however in these past years it’s gotten more glitchy and has more issues. Not to mention the fact that they also removed their customer support email, so now there is virtually no way to solve your issues with instagram(the phone call doesn’t go through). Recently I was reposting a flyer for a high school club event that I wanted people to attend and instagram took the story down, claiming that it was against community guidelines,but offered no reason why. Why would a flyer for a high school club fit into any of the categories mentioned in their community guidelines? I tried different variations of the story, but all of them were deleted by instagram. I decided that I would request a review of the action taken against my story, but discovered that instagram says “Review Request Failed, please try again!” every time I pressed it. So not only can I not contact customer support, I also can’t request a review of an unfair decision that they made. I then decided to try posting the exact same story on a different account of mine and to my surprise it posted on that one. So essentially, instagram is only blocking my account from posting any stories through some weird glitch that I am unable to report to them or request review for. Until they are able to open a way for people to easily contact customer service and stop having useless glitches like the one mentioned above, instagram will be a one star app.",1,,2021-12-09 20:06:24,,,,us,en

I go to open insta and all of a sudden I have the old layout. No more reels button, that’s where the post button is now. And I’ll go and open and close the app to see if it helps but it stays the same, but when I go to another account it still has all of the new features. 
Also, there is an audio bug to where if my phone closes for a sec and I reopen it, the sound of the post it closed on will play over everything. Even if I scroll and play a new video, it plays over it. If I go to close the app, it’ll STILL play even tho it’s not suppose to (and I have background interactions blocked on my phone) 
Also, the “you’ve reached the end of all recent posts, so here’s some from yo suggested feed!” Has got to stop. 
I follow those people for a reason. You don’t even SHOW every post the people I follow make. You only post the most recent ones, as in within about 7 hours, then take away all that and put your own stuff. I have a suggested feed and a following feed for a reason, there was no need to combine the two and I literally missed the fact that I’m an UNCLE because the post was made more than a day ago since I was last on, and didn’t find out until two weeks later when they made a post on their story about my nephew.

Especially during this time of being apart. However, now with the unbelievable amount of ads it is nearly impossible to see what I want to see (my family and friends) and due to the new - “you’re all done” feature I constantly miss posts and here is why: If I open my feed and look at some posts from friends, I can see there are several I haven’t scrolled to look at yet, I then click over to open a message, when I look back at Instagram those posts are gone and I cannot see them again unless I can possibly remember who posted something and to individually look at each of their pages. I HATE that feature that is now in Instagram. To me the benefit of the posts is I can always just scroll down to review them. Now each post is pretty much a story, see it once and it’s gone forever and now I have ENDLESS ads. Once you have viewed your new posts you can’t see them again all you see are ads.  Don’t get me wrong, I do like SOME ads, they are personalized and helpful. But I’d rather they show up only in my stories than on my feed. I’m probably going to delete Instagram as soon as I can find a different way to see friends and family’s posts and not miss any because of the inundation of ads that is here.

Sean picked us up at the swanky South Seas Resort Marina, where he had to give my name at the gate to get us in (we were impressed!) We cruised to a private island where we walked along the shoreline looking for shells, not another person in sight! I could imagine a romantic picnic or sunset dinner on the island, but that is another trip! Next, we tooled around some fishing huts built in the 1920’s! So cool! Then we boated over to another island accessible only by boat where we enjoyed cocktails and a delicious lunch! Sean played with dolphins and got them to swim alongside us, which made our day! Sean is personable and thoughtful, eager to point out interesting spots on the islands to ensure we enjoyed our trip! He had all the equipment fishing charters have, and he impressed us with fishing stories, if you are looking for a fishing charter.

Then last week, several friends and I lost access to our ability to DM for over a day on the apps platform; thankfully the DMs started properly working again the following day because I had to log onto the website platform instead of using the app just to communicate with people via DM.. so I was frustrated about that as well and then the issue of security breaches on this app is just becoming insane and they make it ridiculously hard for you to retrieve you account because everything is automated. So if you’re for say sleeping and someone breaches your account they can go in amar it’s change your email address and since you can’t you know answer security questions you’ve set in place to verify it’s you or speak to any representatives I’ve seen a lot of people permanently lose their accounts.

I follow 200+ people, 80% of whom update regularly, yet instagram is making it impossible to see them.

And posts are being BURIED with this new update. Half the time the ""new"" posts on my timeline are 1-2 weeks old & the posts in my ""older"" tab are from the same day. As a creator myself, my engagement has dropped exponentially, as Instagram is making it increasingly difficult for my work, & the work of others, to be seen.

And that's not to mention the horrific placement of the new reels tab, dead in the center of the app, with the new shop page directly right, kicking both the post button & the notifications tab to the top of the screen on the home page. As a small business, this is FRUSTRATING to say the least. It seems like instagram is hell bent on punishing the very people that keep their app alive. At the very least, give people the autonomy to organize their app tabs the way they want to & choose to have a chronological home feed or an algorithmic based one.

How are you going to tell me you can’t confirm my identity when that account has pictures of my face. The hacker texted everyone I followed and they were asking for money and their phone numbers so they can reset their old account or their phone isn’t working and they need help.

It becomes slightly irritating that the app will work one way one day and the next some random change will be made to either the explore page or the home page that just doesn't make sense based off of its history. My example right now would be the new reels that were introduced. Now when I go on the explore page there is a huge portion of it being taken up by reels that I don’t want there. Sure, reels is cool but I went to the explore page, not the reels page. Another example that also happened recently was where I opened the app one day and my home page didn’t show any of the pages I followed and instead showed random pages. It took me a minute until I realized I had to click on “see older posts” before I could see the old posts. Not that I care for this too much, but it was just irritating for no reason to suddenly have pages I don’t follow showing up in the section of the app meant for only pages that I follow.

This is why I was really interested in using Instagram to try and help out my barber career. The one annoying issue I’m having is when it comes to trying to add an action button for booking. I have tried this with three different booking apps so far and with no luck. For example I am trying to add my square appointments app as a book option on my business account. The videos I have seen about how to do this, show that once you click on the app you use to schedule your clients, you need to enter in the URL that will link them to your booking page. I believe this is where the problem is. Instagram doesn’t give me an option to enter a URL. The order that Instagram sends me is ( connect website > please select business to connect > connect to Instagram > connection successful). Then when I refresh my page there is no action button. I have used three different booking apps in hopes that one of them would work and none of them do. I have the online booking option turned on within the app as well and it still doesn’t work. It’s extremely frustrating and to add onto it, I can’t find anywhere online to help me. There’s no way to contact Instagram, at least from what I have seen and it feels like it’s never going to work for me. This app could easily be a 5 star, but this one problem is really making it hard.",2,,2020-07-02 23:05:19,,,,us,en
