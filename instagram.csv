I have tried so many things from updating everything, logging out and logging back in, uninstalling and reinstalling the app several times, going to someone‚Äôs story to look for the ‚ÄúTry It‚Äù button but nothing, unlinking my Facebook account, changing my password and updating profile.. which btw didn‚Äôt let me change it to my personal email because it was taken already, I have never used it so I clicked on forgot password to see who has been using my email but it says that it doesn‚Äôt exist so I‚Äôm a little confused on how it has been taken but doesn‚Äôt exist. But anyway I reported the Music Tag issue awhile back but haven‚Äôt heard back since then, so I reported the issue several times back to back to see if that works (prob not). All the research I have done over this issue has been through Google through other users experiences because IG doesn‚Äôt even have support help over this issue. The only thing that has inconveniently worked was to make a second account, everything shows up on there but as soon as I switch over to my account that I use it‚Äôs not there! INSTAGRAM..

Involving stories that were once present in older highlights. As well newer stories from archive added to said highlight. For starters my highlight revolving around music that I listen to on the daily. Has recently removed each and every story from weeks even months ago. Before you ask I indeed checked to see if my music highlight was at capacity. Just to find out it wasn‚Äôt even at full capacity. Another instance involving this issue is a recent questions highlight I created yesterday. When I first created that highlight all was well. Only for twelve or so hours to pass. I find the highlight cleared nearly all of the stories I previously added, gone. Surely enough I go to re-add those stories to the same highlight. That didn‚Äôt work because it glitched again taking out three more stories from that same highlight. It‚Äôs really hard to explain the issue due to it really getting to me. There‚Äôre so many memories I had in separate highlights. That are no longer present in those other separate highlights. As a matter of fact I‚Äôve been dealing with a story archive issue. Where most of my arched stories are greyed out and others greyed out with dates on them.

This more of me adding that I still haven‚Äôt received the notes feature. Though the app itself has been working decently well of recently. So I went ahead and bunked it up to three stars.",3,,2023-04-18 03:32:31,,,,us,en

I‚Äôve checked to see if the app is up to date and it is 100% up to date, I‚Äôve checked my iPhone‚Äôs iOS system thinking that could be the culprit because it has been before in the past with other apps that acted up when it wasn‚Äôt up to date, but my iOS system is up to date. I‚Äôve read it could be a poor internet or WiFi connection and that‚Äôs not true because my connection signal is pretty strong as I‚Äôm in the next room over from where the WiFi box is located and I receive a strong signal so it isn‚Äôt our WiFi connection. This is really frustrating and irritating and annoyance to me that it makes me so stressed out every time I go on Instagram and see that information bar there when it wasn‚Äôt there last month only recently. Please Instagram for the love of god fix this issue!! I‚Äôve done everything I could on my end to fix it and nothing has changed.

I see more recommended posts and ads than i do people i actually follow and when i do i dont even get posts that are up to date, i see post from 1-3 days ago, even with profiles that post daily. instagram was better before the stories but that was probably all it needed, and reels are basically a knock off tiktok, the messenger icon couldve been left on facebook and i cant even see my messenger chats on instagram anyways; so whats the point? On top of that accounts with large fan bases have tons of sexual bots that spam inappropriate comments and promote inappropriate content and it‚Äôs been that way for almost a year now. Then the community guidelines violates the freedom of speech in plenty of ways to where you cant even say the word ‚ÄúLame‚Äù without violating the terms of service but some chick can spread her cheeks n clap her milk jugg together and talk about how the whole internet seen them get railed no problem like ??? this app needs to be fixed before adding more unnecessary features that we never needed, we was fine after the reels update, all we wanted was the bots gone, thats it, gif jus made the comment community die and annoying to those who actually spoke to one another. basically before the gif update it was a black ops 2 search & destroy lobby, now its like an old lady making sweaters on her front porch üôÑü§å",2,,2023-02-17 09:24:42,,,,us,en

I made a bunch of friends within the art community and what not, which I why I liked this app quite a bit. However, recently, Ive kinda grown a disliking towards IG- I have noticed that there are tons of updates, it seems like once or twice a week I check and IG needs and update, which annoys me because these updates don‚Äôt change a thing about the app (and when it does, it just moves on or two features around). And, on the topic of updates, the one with the notes feature didn‚Äôt add the feature to my main account and put it on an account I barely even use instead- I sent in two complaints/reports about this almost a month or two ago and nothing has come out of it. (Also, I from what I am hearing, the notes feature is gone so I guess this is no longer a major issue?) And this is not the first time Ive had an issue like this. There have been multiple updates before in the past year or two where the new features only go to the account I don‚Äôt really use, which annoys me because I have sent in reports about it before yet I still have the same problem. Also, recently there have been quite a few bugs/lags with the app, which is becoming more frequent- I guess sum it up, this app needs some serious fixing- It was just fine (for me anyways) before the past update or two, but now its just crappy-",2,,2023-03-18 19:41:32,,,,us,en

But now the problem has worsened and I am not even able to save any music nor see/use any of the music i had saved before this was an issue. I have reported this problem to instagram multiple times over the course of about 5 or 6 months and they have yet to respond in any sort of way, let alone fix the problem.

This problem has been aggravating and upsetting, and the fact that i and many others have tried to reach instagram to fix this issue, yet have not even been addressed, only adds to those emotions. The music was one of, if not THE most used feature for me on instagram. I have tried multiple methods on my own to resolve this issue but nothing has worked.

Sound4Airpods are bugged!,"I have been using instagram for about 4 years now and I don‚Äôt know if this has been an ongoing problem but whenever I screen record an audiorecording while using Airpods Pros I get the sound but it always switches to Spatial Audio for some weird reason! I‚Äôve tried to look up solutions for the problem but it seems that this has been an ongoing problem for many users of instagram. I post  the audio recording on my stories and it seems to never turn off spatial audio despite the setting being off. The audio recording sounds so weird with spatial audio enabled permanently for instagram. On the other hand, I have also tried to post the audio recording on stories with different earbuds on‚Äîthey were not Airpods‚Äîinstead of spatial audio being on with the different earbuds it instead makes the audio recording sound a little bit lower quality. From my understanding I think it may be the quality of the audio recording. After making this hypothesis, I converted my audio recording to higher quality formats, which included flac and wav files. I did this and again uploaded the audio recording on my stories: it still had spatial audio with the Airpods. With different earbuds it may do the same, play it with lower quality.

Instagram made no attempt to request anything of me to prove otherwise before disabling my account where I had 22K followers. For approximately a month now I have submitted everyday a web base form with a copy of my state issued ID to dispute it and no one has contacted me. I created another account so that I can fulfill my obligations as a sponsored athlete and even with my new account I have been limited to how many likes I can do, commenting on other‚Äôs post and even adding captions to my own post. 
It feels personal and I don‚Äôt understand why this has happened. I believe the way disabling my account was handled was unfair considering my content never ever violated any of IGs policies. I still do not violate any but yet my activity is limited which does not help me as an athlete. I‚Äôm thankful my reputation and character preceded me in that my sponsors are still working with me but I did almost lose one but thank God for good associates.

It‚Äôs not right that I put in so much effort and time, and people who intentionally followed me don‚Äôt see my post right away unless they are actively searching for my posts on a regular basis. Choosing to follow an account should be enough, why should I have to go out of my way to like and comment on their posts in order to keep seeing their posts higher up in my feed? Just because I don‚Äôt like posts by old high school friends who don‚Äôt know how to use a camera doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt want to see their photos, doesn‚Äôt that make sense? And if I have 3000 followers, I would expect at least 2000 of them to see my post. Why is it that only 500 or less of them see my post? Over time, I have posted better content, and I‚Äôve posted more consistently, I try to post to my story regularly, I try interacting with followers, why is it that my engagement has steadily declined?

Update: I‚Äôve spent 10+ years on this app, posting high quality content, using the new features, and Instagram still treats my account like it‚Äôs worthless. I see garbage accounts get blasted with attention and gain thousands of followers, meanwhile, I‚Äôve barely scraped by.

It is literally adjusting your settings without your knowledge and combing through your personal information. It is also tracking what other apps you are using on your phone.

Recently I was reposting a flyer for a high school club event that I wanted people to attend and instagram took the story down, claiming that it was against community guidelines,but offered no reason why. Why would a flyer for a high school club fit into any of the categories mentioned in their community guidelines? I tried different variations of the story, but all of them were deleted by instagram. I decided that I would request a review of the action taken against my story, but discovered that instagram says ‚ÄúReview Request Failed, please try again!‚Äù every time I pressed it. So not only can I not contact customer support, I also can‚Äôt request a review of an unfair decision that they made. I then decided to try posting the exact same story on a different account of mine and to my surprise it posted on that one. So essentially, instagram is only blocking my account from posting any stories through some weird glitch that I am unable to report to them or request review for. Until they are able to open a way for people to easily contact customer service and stop having useless glitches like the one mentioned above, instagram will be a one star app.",1,,2021-12-09 20:06:24,,,,us,en

First is the amount of bots, fake, and duplicate accounts that are on IG.

Another example that also happened recently was where I opened the app one day and my home page didn‚Äôt show any of the pages I followed and instead showed random pages. It took me a minute until I realized I had to click on ‚Äúsee older posts‚Äù before I could see the old posts. Not that I care for this too much, but it was just irritating for no reason to suddenly have pages I don‚Äôt follow showing up in the section of the app meant for only pages that I follow.

There‚Äôs no other app that can connect me as a photographer to clients such as artists and models in my area better than Instagram and I am therefore forced to use it as my primary social media to upload photos. The issue is that Instagram does not support photos in any way shape or form anymore. Their algorithm has not been supporting photographers for a while and I can get over that but with the most recent update they‚Äôre starting to ruin the quality of my photos by overly compressing them. Having my photos be of viewable quality is basically my only concern when posting them and Instagram has robbed me of that entirely with no way to fix it. It‚Äôs incredibly disappointing because my following and networking is all built upon my photography account on Instagram and I don‚Äôt really have the opportunity to switch at this point. I doubt Instagram is going to care because countless people have been complaining about this but seriously if anyone from Instagram is reading this just let us post photos at a normal quality, I mean for real my photos have started to look horrible recently and I‚Äôve been doing nothing different. I‚Äôm not even asking for much because LITERALLY A FEW DAYS AGO I WAS POSTING PHOTOS WITH NO ISSUES JUST GO BACK TO THEN THIS IS RIDICULOUS INSTAGRAM.

The change to messages that make it so swiping prompts a reply to someone rather than exiting is confusing and non-intuitive, not to mention outright useless. The changes to the placement of the notification and posting tabs are infuriating. This is an app for sharing, not for shopping. Keep the shopping tab out of the main tab bar and put reels back with explore.

Instagram would be much more user friendly if there was an option to toggle certain features (although calling them features instead of ‚Äúhinderances‚Äù might, in some cases, be generous), such as the swipe-to-reply in messages, the suggested posts after the most recent posts in the home section, or whether posts were ordered algorithmically or chronologically. Additionally, allowing users to set up the layout of their tab bar would also make it more user friendly.

Its absurd to think that because you dont pay per post, even with a good follower to post activity ratio, your posts dont take priority among your own followers or area. Instagram took the fun out of discovering people and forces those who pay to play down your throats. The bigger accounts just saturate the market and everyone else gets forgotten. Personal pages should NOT be penalized for not paying to promote posts where as business profiles should. IG, like every Google product, is self imploding and destroying itself by its obsession with catering to ads. Not the creatives who even bring traffic to IG in the first place. Remember what happened to Tumblr? The first IG? Yea its going in that direction.

Maybe if people want to hide all the ‚Äúig models‚Äù they like you can add a setting to hide just YOUR stuff from your followers ‚Äúfollowing activity‚Äù.

Here are some recommendations: Allow us to see our profile picture in full view because sometimes we end up deleting the original photo but want to get it back, so if we have the ability to do that we can just screenshot it from tapping on our profile picture to make it a bigger screen for us to screenshot OR add a 30 day limit to where stuff we don't post or when we take pictures and discard them, they are still held somewhere if that makes sense.

For example, the comments are not in chronological order;making them very confusing. I have found a similar problem in the feed algorithm. They are not in chronological order anymore. You will see a post from 2 weeks ago, and then a post from 2 DAYS ago. Next, there should be a bigger time frame for videos. You cab only have a video that is 1 minute long. I wanted to post a slime review, but the video was 2 minutes long so I had to do it in 2 separate videos even though all of the slimes came together. Finally, I think you should fix the messages. You can always see if someone has seen your direct message. This isn't exactly a problem, but I think there should be an option, in case someone does not want people to know when they have seen their messages. Please take these suggestions into consideration. I know I am not the only person complaining about these things. Other than those problems, I have only had good experiences with Instagram. It is very easy and fun to use.

However recent changes in the functionality of the app have been making me consider fully deleting my account. First the algorithm was changed from seeing most recent posts first to posts you interact with most, which makes it so you don't see over half of the content from creators you're following and your followers don't see your posts. Then this new update replaced the notification and post tabs with reels and shop, which seriously effects it's usability. Now my notifications and post buttons are in an awkward hard to reach spot, instead of being easily accessible. Everyone I've asked have agreed that this new update is terrible, and that NO ONE cares or asked to have a whole shopping section on a photo sharing platform. This update feels like Instagram is desperately trying to pull users from other apps like TikTok and Pinterest instead of focusing on its own user base and their wants. I am so incredibly disappointed in Instagram's team for consistently refusing to acknowledge their user's concerns. If this update isn't reversed and/or if more terribly inconvenient updates are released, I'm definitely going to be leaving the platform. Furthermore, try implementing useful updates such as being able to reorder or remove photos from old posts. I think such feature would resonate well.

Also, IG app apparently is not compatible with any audio apps, for instance, if I try topost to IG while listening to music, IG interrupts the music as soon as the app is opened so apparently I either have to create each post in silence or wait until I'm not listening to music (or more likely just skip posting altogether, especially since IG content is HIGHLY censored by Meta to only show a couple posts at any given time so they can keep the feed at 75% adsand above). My feed NEVER shows more than 3-4 posts at a time even if I don't check for days. The rest is all ads and since they don't use any personal interests or settings to curate their ad freds, most of the ads are garbage.

There are 2 dozen other photo apps in the iOS store at present with more features, better integration, faster processing & less battery drain than what you can find with Instagram. iPhone‚Äôs photo editing tools are so much superior to IG that it sort of baffles me why anyone with a modern handset would want to use those features.

I, unlike most, really like Instagram stories and I love how you can save stuff without having to screenshot. My complaint however is my home feed. I‚Äôm tired of only seeing posts from 5 of the 200 people I follow. I wish there was a way to have it be in chronological order, but you can make it so that specific people do show up at the top of your feed. This may sound a little silly but it‚Äôs pretty embarrassing when you accidentally like and comment on a post from 5 days ago as if it was posted ten minutes ago. Really I don‚Äôt understand why Instagram is making all these frankly useless updates to the algorithm. Instead of that they should be cracking down on how the thumbnail (starter photo?) for a video has nothing to do with the video. Now that‚Äôs something that needs worked on. I feel that these algorithm changes only benefit the people exploiting Instagram and hurts regular users content intake. This is a little long so in short great app but please stop messing with my feed, or at least give me the option to change it back to the way it was if I so please.",5,,2018-01-20 06:06:31,,,,us,en

The fact i could be following someone and their feed may be COMPLETELY different from mine, but because i‚Äôm following them, i‚Äôll end up seeing what they like when i go the explore page. Even when I try my hardest to make sure my feed consist of art and such, the algorithm still manages to throw it off by showing me people (all of whom i really may not care about) due to maybe 1-3 people i decide to follow, that has a different taste than i do, so their feed somehow ends up intertwining with my explore page/my feed, and i end up seeing the people they follow and what they like (when i really don‚Äôt care). If I PERSONALLY decide to follow one individual, I don‚Äôt need a flood of other people popping up letting me know who that ONE individual is following and what they may like. I find that highly annoying.
I also miss when instagram videos used to loop, instead of having to constantly replay it, i miss how it used to loop a video. 
Navigating through instagram is becoming obnoxious and i cannot stand it. The algorithm on this site/app is HORRENDOUS!

I also feel that a few of the features that used to be on there were so much better and easier to get to.
Archived Stories, for example. Whenever your story would disappear after the 24 hours ended, you‚Äôd get a notification saying how many people viewed it. Now, that‚Äôs not there anymore, and I have to go to my archived just to see who looked at my stories.
 Another thing is the hashtag following (or whatever it is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). For me personally, I‚Äôve never used this. I tried it once and just thought it was annoying cause the posts would go on my feed, and I‚Äôd be thinking that I‚Äôm just following these accounts when I wasn‚Äôt.

The waitress was very good but no name tags?  Management too cheap?  How do I request a table next time with the same server?
Now the downside.  The bar area was nice and cool on a hot day, BUT the dining area facing the Lake where everyone ate was WARM and uncomfortable.  I asked if they could do anything about it and the gal in the bar area agreed that it was warm and said she would ask.  Ask?  She has to ASK when it is obviously uncomfortable?  The thermostat was on an inside corner of the dining area.
I also noticed that the whole Fitgers shopping area on the street level was warm!  They must not be able to afford air conditioning?  Not sure I would want to shop there.
Parking was on the street.  Because the Boat House is understaffed and service is very slow I had to go back and put another hour on the meter and that was barely enough.

I can speak from experience because I have watched my likes go down as Instagram has changed their algorithm. People like things which are unique! Keep Instagram different and unique and make other platforms want to be like you, not you wanting to be like them. If the changes are based off of Statistics, realize the functions of other apps. Snapchat for instance, people like it simply because it is very private. On Instagram you are able to send pictures to people however they can be uploaded from the camera roll and used to look like the picture was taken just then.. this makes Instagram very user friendly for catfishes. Just keep the traditional Instagram aspects and forget about conformity. Make it so dm pictures- if uploaded from camera roll, it states that. Additionally, make the feed tendered to followers which a users look at most frequently.

To start, Instagram‚Äôs inability to listen to the problems that its users have or try to fix them is incredibly frustrating. I was attempting to make a birthday post for a friend of mine; with a large number of photos selected and many tags. It took me well over forty-five minutes to make this post. It told me that my photos couldn‚Äôt post and that they would try again when they had a better connection. Naturally, I went to the internet, searching for a solution. I realized, after scrolling fairly far back in Reddit feeds, that this problem has been existing for over four years and Instagram has done nothing to fix it. One of the troubleshoot ideas a Redditor suggested was to log out and back into my account. When I did so, it deleted the post I was attempting to make and all of my drafts. The fact that this app can‚Äôt complete a basic function it was made to do- the creators chose the photo and tag limit, not the users- and then deletes the entirety of my work and my drafts is absurd and unwelcome.

I have spent the entire summer posting and building a following. I posted a reel this morning and I received a message that my account has been deactivated!! There was nothing inappropriate about the post, it was of a handbag. I went through all of the steps to report the problem but nothing is working. This is fraud. My account is 100% legitimate and I have put 100‚Äôs of hours into it. I am sitting here in tears because all of my hard work and dedication is gone. I need this to be resolved ASAP. I do not want to have to switch to TIK TOK and learn how to use a whole new forum but if my account is not restored with all of my content that I have spent hundreds of hours and more than $1,000 to create I will have no choice but to abandon Instagram and learn how to use Tik tok only. Please do not force me to do this. I have been a loyal Instagram user for years. PLEASE REACTIVE MY ACCOUNT SHOPPARKERREED!!!!!!!!! 24 hours later all of my hard work is gone. I am devastated. Instagram you should be ASHAMED of yourself. I have paid for hundreds of dollars of ads from your fraudulent vile service. You have crushed my hard work and completed negated all of my hard work this summer. Please restore my account or give me my money back.

Kelsall,Going down the drain fast,"I‚Äôve had an account for 5 years and in that 5 years I‚Äôve never seen a single bit of support from Instagram for anyone. Artists in particular are constantly brushed to the side to make way for unerage girls shaking their backsides and guys doing stupid parkour tricks that we‚Äôve seen a thousand times.
Recently I discovered that they AUTOMATICALLY put a sensitivity control on our accounts. The default is the ‚Äúlimited‚Äù option and it limits what ‚Äúsensitive content‚Äù you see. There have been posts made about how to turn this off. Howeverr for some unknown reason, I cannot. I can‚Äôt even get an explaination as to why I‚Äôm being treated like a child. So I‚Äôm conveniently stuck on the limited option with no app update and no way to turn it off. I‚Äôm undeniably angry. 
To further this, Instagram, and Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, has also come out and said they will be turning more into TikTok than focusing on being a picture-sharing platform like they‚Äôve always been. Mosseri posted a video on Twitter explaining this. So artists, once again, are being brushed aside and left in the dust so Instagram can try to be more like TikTok.
What I‚Äôm trying to say is if you are an artist or you want to share pictures, and you don‚Äôt have time to make Reels every single day to keep your head above water, do NOT get Instagram. I‚Äôm currently looking for alternatives because I‚Äôm sick of it.",1,,2021-07-23 13:32:33,,,,us,en

I struggle with a lot of perfectionism and social anxiety, and so I tend to hold a lot of my personal value in how many likes I get on a post I make.  It would just be nice to not have ‚Äúhow many people like this‚Äù be the reason I choose or don‚Äôt choose to post something, or have it become criteria for my self worth.  But, this isn‚Äôt to say that people can‚Äôt actually ‚Äúlike‚Äù my post.  They still could, it‚Äôs just that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to see it.

Also, it would be lovely to be able to disable the explore page of Instagram for certain times of the day.  I spend hours, and I mean HOURS, on the explore page avoiding and procrastinating my work.  I like having the app around on my Home Screen, I just would like to not feel like as soon as I open it I am going to waste the day scrolling.  I know the whole point of an app is to have people use it, but I think I would use it in a much healthier way if I had the option to place restrictions for myself within the app.",4,,2021-04-14 21:11:00,,,,us,en

You would think this problem would be fixed by now because as it has come to my attention it‚Äôs not a small group of people suffering from this but instead A LARGE AMOUNT. I love Instagram but this small bug has really irritated me, because reposting and sharing posts to my story is important to me, especially in this time. 
I‚Äôm only 15 and I might sound naive but I can say that I am very, VERY disappointed that the company of Instagram, or whoever fixes these bugs has yet to fix this one. It is a big deal considering it is one of the MAIN features of this app and it can be fixed, I know it. SO, like any other bug, it needs to be fixed NOW!! Before everyone gets angry and starts to put negative ratings on this app. 
I‚Äôm rating this a four star because I have pity on the app itself. If it‚Äôs not going to be fixed and eventually ignored, I‚Äôll just delete it and put my rating lower. I know Instagram will see this because there are others who‚Äôve complained and have yet to be responded.

First off, after you post multiple pictures in one post, you should be able to delete some pictures out of the post without having to delete the whole post. This would make so many users more happy because there are countless times when you accidentally post one picture in a group of pictures that you don‚Äôt like, but you didn‚Äôt realize it in time and you already have many likes and comments so you don‚Äôt want to delete the whole post and you just stay stuck on what to do. Also, if you creators made a way to preview certain pictures on a private account that the creator of the account puts up that would be amazing! It‚Äôs difficult to tell who some people are sometimes when you are only able see their profile pic so if you were able to select a few pictures from camera roll to put up (no likes or comments involved) it would be a huge help.

 Thank you creators for the amazing app:)

First I couldn‚Äôt edit my drafts in the app and would have to download them which decreases the quality of your video. Because the quality is now no longer as good the views go down. After this continued it then became so I couldn‚Äôt post cover photos to my reels and each time I did give my reels an aesthetically pleasing cover photo Instagram would remove it later. This too was frustrating. Finally the last straw was after posting a reel I began to get likes but even after several refreshes it said the video had 0 views. How can a video have likes with no views? I became so frustrated I deleted the app in order to hopefully refresh and restore it however doing this made things worse. Now my Instagram has for some reason reverted to the old version with the old discovery page and the old menu bar that has no reels viewing option or reels create option. So now I can‚Äôt create reels at all why??? I reached out to IG but instead of Recieving help I became shadow banned. Now this app is completely useless as I can no longer create my content for my page and business and I did nothing wrong nor did I violate any guidelines. I do not understand this but I can no longer try to use an app that clearly doesn‚Äôt want people like me on it.,1,,2021-12-16 03:40:20,,,,us,en

I will go on Facebook and see a picture posted that states it is linked with Instagram but never see it on my Instagram feed.  Also when you refresh it will take some of them completely off of the feed instead of putting them towards the bottom.  Can you please fix it! This is causing people to not get any likes at all. My followers say they never see my pictures unless they search my profile. I keep seeing the same pictures over and over again. Some days I get half of the likes I normally do because people do not see my pictures. This is very frustrating. 

Another thing that is annoying is the adds that I don‚Äôt ask to see. They are very creepy because they relate to the things that I like but that‚Äôs not why I got instagram. It seems like this app is trying to copy every other social media app such as Snapchat and Facebook.

I can deal with changes to layout, and bugs. What i can‚Äôt deal with is feeling like i am being thrown into what feels like a money making business. I understand you want to make money, but instagram originally was a platform to share photos and videos that‚Äôs it. I like to think of it as my digital journal, but now it feels like a task to even navigate and find posts that I genuinely want to see. Consider that maybe not everyone wants to be invaded with things to buy even if it is targeted to us, it is unecessary because if we truly need a product we know exactly where to get it without the need of Instagram invading our experience. Instead of cultivating posts you think I would like, leave it up to me the human to make those decisions. I like to think for myself. And what‚Äôs up with changing the chronological order of posts? What sense does it make to cycle in and out older posts from users. It is not useful, people like to feel in control. Instagram used to be a cool platform to literally EXPRESS and only that!

But recently I have started an art account and it was going smoothly the first probably 7 months until Instagram updated and now no one sees my posts. I‚Äôm not gaining followers because my posts aren‚Äôt recommended because IM NOT A BIG ACCOUNT. It honestly irks me to see how my hard work to draw and post almost every day is now basically all for nothing because everything is being handed to the bigger accounts. Smaller accounts are now butted to the side and ignored. There is almost no was of growing. I use hashtags, my story, and I posted regularly‚Äî yet my numbers still decreased with the new update.

Please, backtrack and return it to how it used to be. I‚Äôve had many other artists also complain and get discouraged because they feel the same way.

The app chooses the remake things that work perfectly on the app and make it over complicated instead of fixing actual infuriating bugs in the app. If you leave the app halfway through a text, the part of the text will show up in the chat every time you open up that conversation for a day or two until it stops for no reason at all. The app also chooses to implement other features that don't need to be added like changes to the profile page and making it more likely to mis-tap and hit a story button when trying to go back from messages than before. It chooses to implement these kinds of features instead of ones I, personally would really like like a feature to read all story's or better privacy. It also infuriates me that they have not chosen to make and iPad app yet. They know they don't need to make this app better because many people have no choice but to use it, like me.

There are a lot of us out there who really just want this to be a photo sharing app, and don‚Äôt want to perform for the camera as if we‚Äôre some kind of fake reality star. The amount of time it takes to make a reel VS post a photo is staggering, and unreasonable.

Some of these ads have products which according to the reviews, could be from companies that are less than reputable‚Ä¶ So already it‚Äôs begun..Facebook in it‚Äôs march to monetize all aspects that it touches is now slowly but surely souring The Instagram platform with it ads and I‚Äôm sure eventually with other products that will supplant what Instagram originally was to be about‚Ä¶ I will use it until I tire of this which could be sooner than later‚Ä¶ We shall see.",3,,2020-05-21 01:53:22,,,,us,en

First of all, I know that there‚Äôs a highlights section for your stories, but I wish there could be a folder to combine posts. For example, I have a drawing account and it would be nice if I could have a place in my account where I could combine posts from past months. D‚Äôya know what I mean? I tried to screenshot all the posts from the past month, but it was just too much work. 
My second point is about stories. I know that y‚Äôall have added polls and ‚Äútype something‚Äù features. What if you added another feature like those two but the responses were anonymous to the person who posted the story. Sometimes I wanna respond to one of my friends, but I feel embarrassed or insecure about my answer. This feature is not a necessity, nor a need, but it would attract a lot of attention to the youth, like me. Anyway, I believe that these pieces of feedback will liven up the app. Hopefully y‚Äôall add at least one of these in. Sorry for the long post, I had a lot to say, obviously.",5,,2019-02-10 21:56:06,,,,us,en

It‚Äôs a great app for pics and stuff but good luck actually trying to contact a person if you need help. You will never talk to a human at all. And not only that, but they don‚Äôt tell you what happens for account errors. Just always some generic crap. On their support page it asks ‚ÄúWas this information helpful?‚Äù.... um, NO it was not. Connect me to an actual human. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs via phone, email or live chat. Just stop with all the robotic generic responses and let me actually talk to person that will (MAYBE) actually give me a reason for errors and stuff because the support page doesn‚Äôt cover some problems. I would really give this app 5 stars but it‚Äôs severely lacking when it comes to support. Wish I could give it 0 stars.

EDIT:

‚ÄúDoes Tiktok access my wifi?‚Äù I‚Äôll tell you what won‚Äôt be accessing my wifi soon, and that is Facebook, all this meta crap, and Instagram. Tiktok and freedom of speech is STRONG. No I will not be moving my primary social platform to Instagram Or Facebook if tiktok gets banned. As an American, I‚Äôm suffering from EXTREME second hand embarrassment from everything we saw at the hearing and the aftermath. It‚Äôs not even just about tiktok (our rights and privacy) but If tiktok goes, then so will my Facebook and Instagram. 1 star isn‚Äôt low enough",1,,2023-03-28 14:51:22,,,,us,en
110,App Store,710cf3d4-0a9c-4ea3-99a9-75c77896a28f,Ria R. V.,disappointing updates,"So many stupid, unhelpful updates lately. We all know Instagram has been trying to become more like Tiktok, and I hate its overemphasis on reels now. It used to just be a platform of photo-sharing, and this is what made users like it and is what we want. But my explore page is just always filled with reels, and whenever I click on a (often new) user‚Äôs profile it automatically goes straight to just showing reels. It doesn‚Äôt reflect their profile, I want to see ALL their posts‚Äîthe regular, curated profile with all their photos and content. If I wanted to see reels I could click the Reels button myself. It‚Äôs just a constance annoyance‚Äîclicking a user, seeing weird feel thumbnails, being confused, then realizing and having to click to the first tab.

Moreover, it‚Äôs the constant promotions and advertising that Instagram has begun been throwing in your face, all so they can be more profitable. As I‚Äôm scrolling on my feed after a while ALL I see just become suggested post after suggested post. If I wanted to ‚Äúexplore‚Äù other posts I‚Äôd go to the Explore tab, Instagram. I‚Äôm on MY feed to see friends and users that I follow. Why do you continually interrupt this with your constant suggestions (which I know are promotions accounts can pay for and earn them more money)?

Like everyone has been saying, we just the old Instagram back. Please.",1,,2023-01-16 00:43:51,,,,us,en

First, we were allowed to see the first replies to a comment first, but now it‚Äôs back to how it used to be before. For some reason, when you want to see the replies to a comment, Instagram shows you the last 3 instead of the first. You then have to click ‚Äúshow more replies‚Äù to see more, but it only shows you the last 3 again. If you‚Äôre trying to read the first replies to a comment with many, good luck.
They also used to have it so that if you clicked on a comment, you would be taken to this little screen where you could actually see all the comments in order. This saved users lots of time in clicking to see replies. So why did you remove it, Instagram?
Last thing I will mention is their recently added Reels portion. There are many things to say about those, but I want to mention how instagram added an function to pause the videos but removed it in about a week. We can‚Äôt have something as simple as watching a video.
Instagram, please stop removing these useful features, or at least make it so we have the option to turn them on in our settings.",3,,2022-05-22 15:13:37,,,,us,en

The app still auto-refreshes making it so that you never see the post you were on ever again if you tab out and come back. I‚Äôve lost so many good memes and posts thanks to this issue. You also can‚Äôt save reels into folders while in the reels tab either making it super annoying if you want to save it because you have to go to the reel‚Äôs profile page then manually look for it in the grid to save it. There is also the problem with bot accounts and spam accounts and because of the algorithm many pages are now posting images as 1 second videos making it look bad when posting it on your story because of the pre-made format for videos in your story and it‚Äôs really annoying seeing them reels. On top of this, clicking replies in the comments opens it 3 at a time starting from the most recent comment instead of starting from the beginning or opening it all at once which makes it so that you have to sit there spam clicking ‚Äúmore replies‚Äù to see all the replies. (it‚Äôs not like this on ad posts though which opens 3 at a time starting from the older comments) Pretty fun social media app but without any improvements to these long standing issues my rating will stay at 1 star.",1,,2022-03-19 15:12:03,,,,us,en

I had it for a few months and eventually my posts totaled to about 80. I had taken pictures of holidays, trips, vacations, my family, and my dog. For a while, everything was fine and I loved the app, but then I made another slime account. I made this account and started using both of them. After a few days, I was asked to put in my age for some reason on my first account. The one with all my memories. I put it in and the age said I was 12. I then had to try to put in my age a few more times, but I put the same age in. I then was forced off of my first account. I clicked the button to save my pictures, but it didn‚Äôt work. I was so confused because the app said I needed to be 12, but I got an email saying I  had to be thirteen. The app said YOU NEED TO BE 12 NOT 13!!!  I was so mad and upset. All of my memories were gone and I couldn‚Äôt recover my photos.  This needs to be fixed and I want my photos back. 
Another problem with the app is that you can‚Äôt have more than 1 account with one email. I had to start using my family‚Äôs email with their permission so I could have 2 accounts. I don‚Äôt understand why you can‚Äôt have 2 accounts on one email. If o want 10 accounts, I will need 10 emails. That absurd.

It is a source for a lot of my creative inspiration and I love that aspect.  All the new tools that Instagram has incorporated into its app are so amazing and helpful. I look forward to the new features that they will one day include in the future.  One that I hope they include is the ability it add/edit postures once they have been uploaded.  This is something that I struggle with all the time, whenever I'm posting multiple pictures at a time using their sliding picture format, I cannot add onto, delete, or rearrange the order of these photos. I recently just uploaded a pair of two pictures to my page only later to realize that I forgot to add a third photo that I was planning to put.  I think it would be helpful if Instagram added an option to edit pictures in such a way that we are permitted to edit captions.  I do not wish to delete the whole post, but to simply add one more photo to my post.  Instagram please listen to this message for it will help my and several of my other friends who struggle with this same issue!",4,,2019-01-21 06:24:12,,,,us,en
116,App Store,b97cb8c2-78ba-44c7-9414-d8a420200c92,Bolt_X0,Awful algorithm and more,"The algorithm on the app is awful, there‚Äôs bots everywhere, and reporting a user pretty much does nothing. And for artists, despite being a platform *dedicated to sharing images* the quality of the drawings often get crunched. Instagram refuses to do anything about these problems. They could easily fix them yet they don‚Äôt.
Another thing is that it‚Äôs trying to be TikTok, it puts down every regular post in favor of reels. That‚Äôs a major issue if you‚Äôre an artist and don‚Äôt know how to animate. Circling back to the awful quality, it‚Äôs like compressing the image to its lowest form, I‚Äôm somewhat adding hyperbole but the quality is still awful. Bots are an INCREDIBLY large problem. I recently shared some art a few minutes ago and within a minute I got 5 bots telling me to ‚Äúüòçdm here at *insert huge NFT account that‚Äôs stealing art* ‚Äú there‚Äôs almost no way to stop yourself from getting these bots either. 
Another thing about the algorithm is that it hides posts from people. You could only be following one person and one hashtag but that persons post would be covered by reels and ‚Äúsuggestion‚Äù posts. Absolutely awful.
In conclusion, it‚Äôs quite a bad app. The only reason I‚Äôm staying is so that the people who somehow DO see my art despite the horrid algorithm, can enjoy it if they don‚Äôt have Twitter.",2,,2022-10-17 00:27:20,,,,us,en
117,App Store,7a399790-2847-44c1-b5a6-adceca43703c,MissV_3,Instagram is a bully,"They will delete your account without any warning and it doesn‚Äôt matter if your content is good or bad. They don‚Äôt care how their users feel about the new algorithm updates. Don‚Äôt bother trying to make a complaint, no one will respond. Your content gets restricted or shadow banned depending on what you post or what hashtags you use. If you‚Äôre a conservative, don‚Äôt bother using this bias platform to voice your opinions, they will shut you down. You‚Äôll see the same 20 people on your timeline regardless of how many 1000s you follow. Advertising is everywhere and can‚Äôt be avoided! Don‚Äôt post often? Consider your account deleted for not using it. The new algorithm makes you interact more with followers so that your content is seen but yet my likes continue to drop and more of my longtime followers have unfollowed me. When I message them to ask why they all said they didn‚Äôt unfollow me and thought I did. So not only does Instagram restrict accounts they don‚Äôt like or consider popular but will also remove some of your most active followers to keep your content from being seen. They act as if they are too good to be true but are really setting themselves up to less than MySpace in a few years.

I really suggest switching to Vero The True Social App! Been there a few months and I love it. Plus, they aren‚Äôt as strict as Instagram and you see content from all the people you follow.",1,,2018-12-30 08:39:55,,,,us,en
